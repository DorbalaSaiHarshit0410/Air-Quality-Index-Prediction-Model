# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction-Model
Air Quality Index Prediction Model Using Linear Regression
Introduction
The Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction project aims to provide accurate predictions of air quality levels using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various environmental factors, this project helps in understanding pollution levels and potential health impacts, thereby promoting awareness and better decision-making for public health.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
Flask (for deployment)

Model
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict AQI levels. The model is trained using historical data, and key steps include:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)
Splitting the data into training and test sets
Fitting the Linear Regression model to the training data
Evaluation
The model's performance is assessed using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
R-squared score: Indicates how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable.
Visualizations are provided to illustrate model performance and prediction errors.
